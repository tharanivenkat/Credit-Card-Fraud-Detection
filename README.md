# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection techniques. Given the highly imbalanced nature of fraud detection (where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal ones), we employ unsupervised learning models rather than traditional classification techniques. The dataset is first loaded and explored for missing values, followed by a visualization of class distribution and transaction patterns. Fraudulent and normal transactions are analyzed separately, including the distribution of transaction amounts and the correlation between features. A 10% random sample is taken to improve computational efficiency while maintaining representativeness. The correlation matrix is plotted to understand feature relationships.

For fraud detection, we use two unsupervised machine learning models: Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Isolation Forest detects anomalies by randomly partitioning data points, while LOF compares the local density of transactions to detect outliers. Both models are trained on transaction features excluding the target variable (Class). Predictions are then adjusted so that fraudulent transactions are labeled as 1 and normal ones as 0. Finally, we evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. This project effectively demonstrates the use of anomaly detection for fraud detection, providing an interpretable and scalable solution for financial security.
